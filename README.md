# iris-flower-species-classification ðŸŒ¸

ðŸ“‹ Description
This project applies the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to classify flower species using the popular Iris dataset.
Developed in Python, the application splits the dataset into training and test sets, scales the features, and trains the KNN model. 
It then evaluates the modelâ€™s performance using metrics such as accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.
Additionally, it demonstrates how a basic machine learning solution can be implemented by predicting the species of a new flower sample provided by the user.
